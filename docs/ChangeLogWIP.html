	<h2>Version 4.5.1</h2>
	<b>Main App:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Removed performance of cost of resorting the main timing grid. This should remove freezes that did occur roughly every 10seconds, when the gird was resorted. This also allows to resort the grid on every update.</li>
		<li>Not unique names - The application has a limitation of requiring unique driver names, for the timing grid to operate correctly. But until now it did not inform the user if this prerequsitie was vioalet. This can happen mainly when running versus AI, when more opponents are selected, than the simulator has name for. Now, a message will appear above the grid stating that such situation happened, and showing the number of unique names, and the list of non-unique names. The check is done every 10 seconds.</li>
		<li><b>R3E Fix</b> - Fixed multiclass support for R3E.</li>
		<li><b>Gap visualization (Experimental, disabled by defualt)</b> - Timing grid can now visualize gaps between drivers by increasing row spacing (up to a predefined height). Can be enabled, and configured, in the options. </li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 4.5.0 - Aggregated Charts for Telemetry Viewer</h2>
	<b>Main App:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Telemetry Logging:</b> Fixed inconsistencies in horizontal acceleration loging, where acceleration would be logged as negative G.</li>
		<li><b>Telemetry Logging:</b> The application will now also log invalid laps. This can be disabled in the options menu. In rare cases where a sim repots two laps with the same number (can happen in outlaps in practice/qualification), the older lap will get overwritten by the newer.</li>
		<li><b>Telemetry Logging:</b> The application will no longer log datapoints when player is in pits. As outlaps are now also logged, this change is to limit the size of outlaps made after the player sat in pits for several minutes.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Telemetry Viewer</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Aggregated charts:</b> Added new kind of charts whitch take all datapoints from all selected laps (please wait until the laps finished loading, before opening the charts), and project them in a way that should help car behaviour analysis. The selector can be opened <b>using the button next to the "Add Lap" button.		
		</b>Each new charts is opened in a new separated window and unlimited number of these charts can be opened, each with different lap selection.</li>
		<li><b>Aggregated charts available:</b> Suspension velocity histogram, RPM histogram, Horizontal Acceleration vs Speed scatter plot, Horizontal Acceleration vs RPM scatter plot, Speed vs RPM scatter plot. More charts will come in next version.</li>
		<li><b>Tracker Change:</b> Tracker or chart will not display proper units, instead of X/Y</li>
		<li><b>Tracker Change:</b> Changed the tracker color</li>
		<li><b>Colors:</b>Lines in multiline charts (i.e. all Wheel Charts), will not have slighly different color for better readability.</li>		
	</ul>

	<h2>Version 4.4.0</h2>
	<b>Main App:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Added <b>Fullscreen button:</b> This button will toggle the window title bar off and on. Currently it is
			placed in not so logical place, will most likely change in the future. :)</li>
		<li>Camber is now visualized on the wheel status (wheels icons will be angled equally to the current camber).
		</li>
		<li>Fuel and Oil Temperatures are now colored</li>
		<li>R3E: Optimal Brake and Tyres temperatures provided by the r3e shared memory are now used. Previously stored
			values are automatically overriden.</li>
		<li>Improved handling of Timed Sessions with extra lap in session remaining calculation (session info and fuel
			prediction).</li>
		<li>R3E: Added the recently released cars to the r3eData.json (so they should no longer be unknown)
		<li><b>Fix:</b> Fixed relative gap to lapped/lapping cars.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Telemetry Viewer</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Auto Refresh:</b> Laps completed after the session was opened will be automatically added to the lap
			list, without the need to manually re-open the session.</li>
		<li><b>New Chart:</b> Suspension Velocity chart added. The value is either from simulator shared telemetry, or
			calculated from suspension travel for sims that only provide suspension travel information.</li>
		<li><b>New Chart:</b> Turbo boost.</li>
		<li><b>New Chart:</b> Camber, available for R3E, RFactor2, Assetto Corsa. Angle units can now be found in the
			settings (degrees, radians, milliradians).</li>
		<li><b>New Chart:</b> DownForce, either divided by rear - front (RFactor2 exposes these, but they don't look to
			be filled) or overall (R3E). Force units can now be found in the settings (Newtons, pound - force)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 4.3.2 - R3E Shared Memory Update </h2>
	The lates R3E release introduced quite a bit of new information into its shared memory (while breaking the
	telemetry). This update adapts the existing functionality to the new Shared Memory model.</br>
	<b>Main App:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Steering information.</li>
		<li>Suspension damage.</li>
		<li>Turbo Boost Pressure.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Telemetry Viewer:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Ride Height.</li>

	<b>Fix</b>: Fixed compatibility with telemetries exported with previous version

	<h2>Version 4.3.0 - Damage Reporting</h2>
	<b>Main App:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>New Feature: </b>Added control lights dashboard. This dashboards informs about car damage and state of
			various car systems (pitlimter, drs, kers/push to pass)..etc. Hover over icon to see what icon is
			indicating. For detailed information, please visit the wiki. Note that not all sims provide all necessary
			information, so some icons will not change state in some sims.</li>
		<li><b>New Feature: </b>Detached/Deflated tyres will now flash red in the wheel status view.</li>
		<li>Lowered the height requiremets for the delta bars, increasing space available for timing grid.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 4.2.0</h2>
	<b>Main App:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Replaced the Water and Oil temperature gauges as they took space unproprtional to their information value.
			They were replaced with a text fields in that area. Information about <b>boost pressure, coolant pressure,
				oil pressure, fuel pressure</b> were also added. This space will be futher utilized in next versions.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Telemetry Viewer</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>New Feature: </b>Single line charts can be switched to "delta with reference Lap". In this mode the chart
			will show the difference in values between the lap and the reference lap. Reference lap is the lap picked in
			the replay control.</li>
		<li><b>New Feature: </b>Telemetry replay control can be pop-up to a separate window.</li>
		<li><b>New Feature: </b>Map View control can be pop-up to a separate window.</li>
		<li><b>Known Issue: </b>The map view control will not properly pop-back once the pop-up window is closed.

			viewing. The added session has to be on the same track/layout/simulator.</li>
		<li><b>New Feature: </b>Added the option to load individual lap from disk (useful for sharing telemetry).</li>
		<li><b>New Feature: </b>Additional buttons added to the "open session dialog" - archive session, open session
			folder, delete session.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 4.0.1</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>New Feature: </b>It is now possible to change the way multiclass position is displayed in timing grid
			(see options).</li>
		<li><b>R3E Fix: </b>Classes with the same performance index will now be handled as a single class by the
			application.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 4.0.0 - Client - Server</h2>

	</ul>
	<h2>Version 3.0.3</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Fuel Overview: </b> Now uses the same session remaining algorithm as the "session remainig" control,
			making the reaming fuel requirements more accurate.</li>
		<li><b>Gap Information: </b> Improved gap information columns. In Practice and Qualification the columns shows
			the relative between best lap times, in race it shows gap in seconds, with one decimal place precision. If a
			sim exposes Gap data (currently r3e, AMS, rFactor2), then those will be used. Changed font to bold to better
			readability.</li>
		<li>Changed colored background for drivers in pit. Drivers in pits, and stationary will have this color faded
			out.</li>
		<li>Added an option to specify location where the application should store its data (telemetry, maps, reports,
			etc)</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Telemetry Viewer</b>

		<li>Map can now be colored to show each sector.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Version 3.0.2</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Critical Fix: </b> Fixed application crashing/freezing when trying to create a new map without telemetry
			logging enabled.</li>
		<li>Improved logger performance, most obvious at race starts, where the application could previously freeze for
			several seconds.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 3.0.1</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Disabled speed sanity check for lap invalidation, because it was very unreliable in the mp enviroment</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 3.0.0</h2>
	<h3>Telemetry Viewer</h3>
	<p>Initial version of telemetry viewer application is available. The second monitor application is now able to
		capture telemetry data while it is in running. These data can then be analysed in the included Telemetry Viewer
		Application</p>
	<p>See the wiki <a href="https://github.com/Winzarten/SecondMonitor/wiki/Driver-Marking">for more information</a>
	</p>

	<h2>Version 2.9.3</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Possible Fix: Windows 7 compatibility</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.9.2</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Changed ChangeLog location to fix display issue</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.9.1</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Change: Timing grid can now be resized, both up and down. Not all of the other controls will, for now,
			resize correctly, so they can get obscured by the resized timing grid.</li>
		<li>Change: Reorganized bottom part, so less important information (pedal inputs + engine temperatures) get
			obscured first</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.9.0 - Basic <b>multiclass</b> support</h2>

	<br />
	<b>Chamges:</b>
	<ul>
		<li> Added New "Class" column displaying the class of the car.</li>
		<li> Position : If the race is multiclass, and the driver is not in the leading class, then the position within
			the class is show, with the overall position in brackets.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Limitations :</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Best Lap/Sector times are, for now, still overall. Making them per-class will require extensive work.</li>
		<li>Assetto Corsa: AC has no multiclass concept in telemetry. The "Class" column will not be populated, and
			overall position will be shown at all times.</li>
		<li>Automobilista: AMS way of reporting classes is weird. Reported class is in reality the manufacturer/team.
			Because of this the position within class has no real value. So, while this information is shown, the
			position will always, on purpose, display the overall position.</li>
		<li>PCars 1: PCars 1 does not report car name, but only class name. This was previously shown in car name
			column. It is now moved to the correct column, but car name is not filled.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.8.11</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>R3E: Porsche 934 Turbo RSR added to DB.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.8.10</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Fix: Fixed critical bug that might cause occasional crash on session start.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.8.9</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Improved unhandled exception logging, for better user issues investigation.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.8.8</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Added Speed and Rpm display (next to the current gear)</li>
		<li>Fix: Car Wheel settings will now save properly</li>
		<li>Fix: Fuel monitor made more resistante to telementry "noise".</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.8.7</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>RFactor 2: Possible MP Crashing Fix</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.8.6</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>RFactor 2: Fix - Delta bars should now work 100% of the time. :)</li>
		<li>Possible fix for the invisible track map.</li>
		<li>Added <b>Open Log Directory</b> button into the settings window for quick access to application log files.
		</li>
		<li>Improved loggin in the "map" area.</li>
		<li>Removed the ability to change the export directory. This directory is now also used by track maps and other
			settings, co changing it makes no practical sense, as it would mean loosing all those settings.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.8.5</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed issue with the app requiring admin privileges, because it wanted erroneously create a directory in the
			install path. This might cause loss of learned maps, because those are now correctly stored in
			MyDocuments\SecondMonitor</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.8.4</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Steering Wheel Angle: </b> In addition to pedal position, the application now also show current steering
			wheel angle. As most sims do not provide the angle, but only a -1 to 1 steering range, it is necessary to
			set the correct steering range in car options for the icon to correlate with you IRL wheel. The default
			angle for each car is 540 degrees. Because R3E do not provide any steering information, this feature will
			not work in R3E.</li>
		<li>Session Remaining: The app will now try to properly estimate remaining player laps in timed session, and
			remaining time in sessions wtih given total laps.</li>
		<li>R3E: Updated car reference file to include the newly released GT4 cars.</li>
		<li>Fix: Fixed an issue when the delta times bar would not display delta time to best lap.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.8.3</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Player Mark - The player is now marked more clearly on the timing grid and map, by a bright greenish color
		</li>
		<li><b>New Feature - Driver Marking: </b> It is now possible to mark other drivers by custom colors. Those
			drivers will then be marked in similar manner as the player, by the selected color. More info at the <a
				href="https://github.com/Winzarten/SecondMonitor/wiki/Driver-Marking">wiki</a> </li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.8.2</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Fuel Overview - Extended endurance information during Races. Fuel Overview now contains delta Laps, delta
			Times and delta Fuel endurance information.</li>
		<li>Change: The timing grid will now try to keep the player in the middle. So the it is possible to always see
			cars both behind and ahead.</li>
		<li>Change: Default tyre compound renamed from Base to Prime... don't ask me where the Base came from :D</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.8.1</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Track Map: Added the ability to rotate the track map.</li>
		<li>Track Map: Increased border around map (works only for newly created maps).</li>
		<li>Track Map: Sectors should now change color based on status (best personal/session sector times, yellow
			sectors). Yellow flags sadly do not work in assetto corsa yet, hopefully in next version it will be fixed.
		</li>
		<li>Fix: Always use circle option should now be perserved when application is closed.</li>
		<li>Fix Rfactor2: The application should now be better at detecting session restarts</li>
		<li>Fix PCars2: Snowing now correctly detected as precipitation</li>
		<li>Fix Assetto Cors: Previous lap time delta should now work correctly.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.8.0</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>New Feature: Track Map - </b>The application is now able to display real track map instead of the
			position circle. One valid timed lap is required for the app to create a map. More information can be found
			in the <a href="https://github.com/Winzarten/SecondMonitor/wiki/Track-Map">wiki</a> </li>
		<li>Fix: Fixed an issue where excel report would not be created if any of the drivers didn't had at least one
			lap completed.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Version 2.7.7</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Fuel Calculator is BACK: </b>Helps to calculate required fuel. More info at the <a
